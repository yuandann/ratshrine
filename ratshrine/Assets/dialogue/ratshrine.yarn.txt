welcome to the rat shrine. you stumbled upon it in an abandoned subway car while wandering the tunnels late at night. it is 3 am. the rats say you will not be able to leave until 3:14. you must appease them until then. what do you do?

you had a fairly sizable ball of lint accumulating in your left pocket. they push it into the their own heap of lint. it’s not food, but they like to roll around in it. it is their one comfort, besides mcdonald’s paper bags.

a pile of mush brown, with a fresher one decorating the pinnacle. its pungent odor grows stronger as you step closer. the rats squeak angrily at you, protective of their decadent bounty.

a bent up stick of trident tropical twist. two of them run up to fight over it as you weakly toss it towards them. they devour the wrapper and gum before it hits the ground. fruity.

stale as hell. not enough for all of them, but the largest one claims the pale, once-crunchy morsels. it appears satiated, though the others seem to protest, whispering and muttering among each other in jealousy.

are these…human bones? probably not. yeah. right? the rats won’t tell you what they are. some of them scuttle over to nibble on them when you point it out. something sticky oozes out of the bites, and it smells like vanilla.

you sit down in the scuffed, orange seats across from the shrine, underneath a torn poster covered by graffiti that you think reads “juicee”. you stare at them. they stare back, eyes glowing.

there is no need, since the rats know what you are thinking. still, you click your tongue at them affectionately. they hiss, opening their mouths in response, and smoke pours out.

there’s a paper cup filled halfway with murky liquid in your hand. when did that get there. it swirls, shifting colors like an oil spill. it smells like lavender. you take a sip. it tastes like grape juice. you down the rest, and place the cup on the altar. the rats squeak in approval.

you pray for health, for your aching feet and frail human body. for longevity and strength. because the rats are older than these manmade tunnels. they carry sickness but do not grow sick. 
they are stubborn, and they survive. you will too.

you pray for fortune, for success and wealth. they sense in your desire something akin to their want for leftover fries, though they don’t understand material want. they’re just feral. they whip their tails around, bewildered. they're not sure what to give you.

when you look up, you’re standing on the platform for uptown 4 and 5. your feet dangle over the yellow border, dimly illuminated by fluorescent lights. you feel as if you have just woken up from a dreamless sleep. you nearly fall forward into the tracks.

you hear squeaking in the distance, and are filled with a sense of dread. you must leave and never return...

you don’t remember how you got here. you only know that you had been seized with a desire to disappear into the tunnels, away from the world. it's time to go back.
